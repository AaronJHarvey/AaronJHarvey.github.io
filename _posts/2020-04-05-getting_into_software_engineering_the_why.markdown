Currently I have a decent job in term of tasks, a boss that is super cool, and as far as sales jobs go I'm not constantly stressed with goals to make sure I get paid so why would I want to give that up for coding? The answer to that is actually pretty simple....Because it's Coding. 

When I was younger I was passively interested in tech, but even being of the generation that grew up with technology and was there really as it was becoming the new norm it wasn't something I really had access too. The area I lived in had not so great schools so it took until I was in 5th grade for us to get a computer lab, and even then we were only given time in the computer lab once a quarter. My home environment wasn't much better when it came to technological advancements, having parents who were both much older than most couples with a new born when I was born meant they weren't exactly inviting of all the new technology that they weren't accustomed to. All that didn't really bode well for my interest in technology or letting my learning about it prosper so it all went to the back burner and was all but forgotten about. 

However, in middle school there was one coding class offered, one of only 3 "extra" classes offered in the school (the others being an art class taught by the football coach who didn't like art, and the other being a photoshop class where everyone shared 5 computers) that interested me, a C++ class. I can't even begin to describe how excited I was when I first started the class. When I got in it though, I quickly found out that this was just like every other class in the school...overhyped and underprepared. The teacher for the class was one one of the bus drivers who had picked up a single block class for extra income and it was a topic they didn't even know so he instead would just tell us to work on homework for other classes and try not to bother him. Once again my interest was sent to the back of my mind and I moved on. It was still always something I was interested in learning one day.

Now, I am out of school and working full time in insurance sells and while I like the people I work with I've found myself feeling unfulfilled and spinning my wheels so I began researching coding and how to get into it. I did a few lessons from places like Udemy and enjoyed it, but knew, especially in my area, finding a job in tech/coding would be nearly impossible to find by just being totally self taught and no connections at all, so I also began looking into bootcamps and after talking with admissions from a few different places Flatiron was by far the most fitting one for me between approach to teaching, cirriculum, cost, and assistance in helping grads get jobs so it was a no brainer. 

I'm really excited to learn and finally take control of my career. # Enter your title here
