I am super super super into coding. It fascinates me, and generally makes in excited especially the thought of actually learning it and hopefully making it my career. That said...this first 6 weeks of the program have seemingly been one huge resilience test for me. Going into the course I obviously anticipated stress and that this wouldn't be easy. However, at the same time the course started everything else in the world flipped and life took a turn. 


As we are all aware the world in general has decided to take one huge downward turn and nothing is the way it should be, seemingly nothing is right, as such my life has been a whirlwind of stress since pretty much the beginning of this course. As someone who works a full time job that is usually more like a 45-50 hour job I have been incredibly blessed in that I have not been misplaced from work. However, I've almost been thrown further into the fire there? My office went from 5 staff members present to myself and maybe the secretary there in person and the rest working from home and sparingly thus the stress level amplified immensely. All that, on top of the general anxieties and stress that I already deal with due to certain conditions in my life AND with the anticipated anxieties of starting a course in a bootcamp have made my mind and body both just want to shut down. I found myself getting behind because the time I was sitting aside to work on it was being cut into and when I did have time my mind has not completely been present and focused the way I want to. 

The project seemed simple enough, and I think that is almost why I struggled so much. I never feel like I'm doing it right even when I am.
