Since my last check in the world has basically only gotten more insane and my personal general anxieties have only gotten worse. That said.. When I have had time and energy to work on coding things have seemingly finally started fully clicking to where I feel like maybe I CAN do this. 



Honestly, I still struggle with some serious imposter syndrome where I worry if I'm fooling myself and if I will actually be good enough with this stuff to actually make it a job, but for the first time there is a little part of me that actually believes that it may be possible. Throughout working on this project I think that my biggest hold up was remembering exactly what paths I needed to send where. It wasn't even necessarily difficult, it was just a decent bit of information and I kept finding myself accidentally sending something the wrong direction. Other than that the securing of the sessions was...not difficult perse, but it was also something that I wrapped my head around the idea, but the concept of actually doing it caught me a few times.

Overall, I would say I am probably feeling the best I have about any "schooling" type thing I have in a while I am super excited for what to do next.
