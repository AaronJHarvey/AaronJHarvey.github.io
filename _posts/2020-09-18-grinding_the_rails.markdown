Sometimes, it just feels like you can't catch a break and for me that's what the entire Ruby on Rails. Every step I felt like I was attempting to catch up and even when I thought I understood something it was like it wasn't fully clicking. 

More or less this was just building on the things we had already done in past and I felt that as a lot of the stuff seemed to be familiar and I could atleast feel slightly more confident in talking about the things. I think that overall my biggest issue that I still have a difficult time wrapping my head around how to implement is sessions and by virtue of said sessions logging in and staying logged in. I get the concept obviously, needing to verify that a person is who they say they are so they can only make changes when the thing they're changing is theirs. I even understand how the session makes it more secure and makes it so the user can't (shouldn't be able to) spoof the system and make the system think they are another user, but for some reason I can't seem to implement it properly. However, when I was able to fully implement it and get it figured out, perhaps my favorite part of this section was the implementing of a 3rd party login/authorization through OmniAuth because it is so interesting to see how easily two websites can communicate with one another to make sure that users are who they think they are.
