After a year that has seen every possible obstacle possible show up I have finally reached the final project of the Software Engineering course here at Flatiron. My goal in this project was to build a Financial Aid that would allow people to keep a list of their accounts as well as the transactions in it and a running balance of what was in those accounts. 

This was actually a really fun project to build after spending so much time exploring Backend database programming and then the frontend Client side of programming it was fun to see the two really come together as one and see how they were interacting. What you would think would be easy communication sometimes would leave me scratching my head for hours at a time. Things like interpolating over a URL we were fetching to so that we could access the information that was only relevant to one given account. Sometimes it would be finicky to the point that I would be positive I had done everything properly, and finding the correct account only to try it and get thrown errors such as "cannot filter through params of undefined" and finally figuring out that the reason it was suddenly returning an account of undefined was because I had made a tiny typo. Overall, this is a project that I left feeling pretty good about, but could view as a good lesson in patience because of the number of hours I would lose based solely to a typo.
